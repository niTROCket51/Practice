### <a name="desciption"></a>1. Description of the Project
The aim of our project is to make a program which would play stone - paper - scissor and should be capable of winning every time. So, we used [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) on [Python](https://www.python.org/) for in order to identify the hand gestures. _(Gestures of paper, scissor and rock.)_ The output is shown on a 10x10 LED grid with the help of [Arduino Uno](http://www.arduino.cc/).

### <a name="dependencies"></a>2. Dependencies
Python 3 (preferably Jupyter notebook) is required to run the project with following dependencies:
- <a name="opencv"></a>OpenCV
> OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

  __Installation__<br>
  `pip install opencv-python`

- <a name="numpy"></a>NumPy
> NumPy is a Python library, which adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

  __Installation__<br>
  `pip install numpy`

### <a name="algorithms"></a>3. Algorithms
While carrying out the project, it was a possibility that the machine learning approach decided earlier may not be fast enough. So, we decided to use multiple algorithms. Below is the list of implemented algorithms:
- **Algorithm 1:**
By drawing the convex hull and finding convexity defects
- //TODO **Algorithm 2:**
Using ends of fingers as markers
- //TODO **Algorithm 3:**
Using Machine Learning

### <a name="implementation"></a>4. Implementation
