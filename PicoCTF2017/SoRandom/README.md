## SoRandom (PicoCTF 2017)
#### Important: Please note that you must run the decoder program on Python 2.7 due to the changes in random.seed() function.

### Problem
> We found [sorandom.py](/PicoCTF2017/SoRandom/sorandom.py) running at shell2017.picoctf.com:37968. It seems to be outputting the flag but randomizing all the characters first. Is there anyway to get back the original flag?
